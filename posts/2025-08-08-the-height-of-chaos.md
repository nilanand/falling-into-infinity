# The Height of Chaos

*August 8, 2025*


I’ve been reading *Blue Lock* (the manga) as of late. It’s not the best thing I’ve ever read, but it has interesting world-building, and terrible power scaling. It’s  hype, but ultimately I’d place it as a solid B-tier manga. That said, it does offer some compelling ideas about talent that I really resonate with.

In *Blue Lock*, there are two kinds of footballers: "geniuses", and what the series calls "“talented learners”"—a clumsy term meant to categorize the non-geniuses. Despite the name, talented learners aren’t untalented. They’re players who perceive the game through logic and intuition. They analyze data and rationalize decisions in real time. Trivial tasks—when to pass, when to shoot, how to read the field—become second nature through repetition and acquired knowledge. These players often have high football IQ and make excellent playmakers, not because they’re born with it, but because they *learned* to see the game.

Geniuses, on the other hand, are... well, geniuses. But I think they’re often misunderstood in media. They’re usually portrayed as people who are just naturally good at everything, but that’s not quite right. To me, geniuses aren’t defined by raw intelligence or logic. In fact, they’re often *illogical*, in the way they operate outside conventional reasoning. Where “talented learners” are thinkers who build understanding through repetition, logic, and analysis, geniuses are more like “*feelers”*. They don’t need to consciously rationalize their actions; they just *do*—often instinctively, without needing a framework to explain it.

Take Sherlock Holmes, for example. He’s not a genius in this sense—he’s a hyper-rational talented learner. Everything he does is grounded in deduction and logic. You don’t have to be Sherlock-level smart to fall into that category—it’s about how you process the world: logically, step-by-step.

But if that’s true, then it also stands to reason that not all geniuses are “successful.” Just as there are mediocre or misguided talented learners, there are “bad geniuses”—people who move through the world on instinct, disconnected from convention, but without the momentum to turn it into anything remarkable. That’s the risk of genius. They don’t necessarily care how the world works—they just follow what feels right. And sometimes that leads to greatness... and sometimes it leads nowhere. 

Sometimes I wonder where I fall in all this. The logical answer would be "talented learner," right? I'm a physics student—I spend my time trying to understand systems, solve problems, analyze structure. Obviously I’m no genius, as I’m a failing student too, but that's just the surface. When I actually stop and think about how I move through the world, I don't start with logic. I start with feeling. I don’t break things down before acting—I just act, and then spend hours afterward figuring out *why* I did it the way I did.

I think that's why I've always struggled with learning so far. Not because I can't follow a plan, but because it feels unnatural to approach the world that way. I don’t *think* in steps. I don’t plan my moves five lines ahead. I work in bursts. In moments. In sudden clarity. Sometimes, I get it right. Other times, I fall flat on my face. And that’s exactly what makes this whole "genius vs. learner" thing in *Blue Lock* so compelling to me. It’s not really about who’s better. It’s about how people *engage* with the world. How they move, how they create, how they perform.

I’m not saying I’m a genius—that would be arrogant, and just wrong. But I do think I operate closer to that spectrum than I’ve ever admitted. I move from feeling. I make decisions not because they’re the smartest or safest, but because they *resonate*. I want to step into the world and just be who I am—fully, instinctively, unapologetically.

And maybe that’s the real allure of genius. It’s not about being exceptional. It’s about being "undeniably authentic". Geniuses don’t adapt to the world—they drag the world into their orbit. They live life on their own terms, win or lose.

That’s the kind of chaos I want to chase.
