Dear Professor Mendez,

Yesterday was my 20th birthday, and I remembered that you had encouraged me to keep you updated on my physics journey, so I wanted to reach out.

To be honest, last semester was my worst academic performance so far. I struggled to stay focused and had difficulty separating my personal life from my academics. My semester GPA dropped below 2.0, and I received an academic warning from the university.

I’m reaching out to you because I feel stuck. I really do want to pursue graduate physics, but I’m worried about how my GPA will affect future research opportunities. I know that research experience matters more than GPA, but I’m unsure how realistic that is in my position.

I'm an international student on an F-1 visa, so I feel additional pressure to make this opportunity count. I’m trying to understand what I may be doing wrong and how to move forward more effectively.

I would really appreciate any advice you might have about rebuilding academically, positioning myself for research, or even just how to think about this phase of my development

Thank you for your time and for everything you’ve taught me.


Best, 

Nilabh Anand
