# Welcome to the Singularity

I made this blog because I’m studying physics and losing my mind in the process.

This isn't a polished site. It's a notebook. A log.  
A record of what happens when someone who likes space-time and hates being graded tries to survive academia.

Right now, I'm trying to figure out:
- What I actually want to do
- Whether I even like math
- If research is for me
- Why I feel pulled toward gravitational waves, black holes, and existential meaning

I don’t have the answers yet.  
But I’m falling into infinity, and I figured—might as well write something on the way down.

Stay tuned for panic, coding, and me philosophizing about equations I barely passed.
