# Directionless Vector
*June 7, 2025*


For the past week, I’ve been spiraling over what my first post should be. I have so many ideas, none of them coherent, all of them demanding to be perfect. I wanted to make a strong first impression, but I realized nobody will read this when it comes out, so it doesn’t matter anyway. I suppose I should introduce myself now, as this blog is, after all, about me.

I’m (currently) a Physics and Astronomy dual-major student at Stony Brook University. That’s the short version. While I wish I could stop right there, the long version is more important. The truth is I’ve struggled. A lot. I’ve passed all of my core physics and math classes with a C. And for most of that time, I kept telling myself that the next semester would be different. It wasn’t. At the time of writing this, I’ll be a sophomore in a few months. My GPA is low. My confidence, too. I’m constantly wondering if I’m even built for this. I’ve spent more hours doubting myself than actually studying. But I haven’t quit. I can’t. Partly because I still care, and partly because I don’t want to live a mediocre life of doing nothing. I want to accomplish something. I want to be someone. I still want to know why the universe works the way it does. I still want to build something out of all these broken parts.

This blog is meant to serve as my daily reflection. I want to hold myself accountable. I can’t say anything was out of my control anymore. This time, it will be different.  

It has to.
