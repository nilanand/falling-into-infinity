# Nobody said it was easy
*November 11, 2025*
Finals season is in two weeks, and I’m underprepared. I’m behind in half my classes, and my grades have slipped hard.

I don’t know what went wrong. I was caught up at the beginning of the semester—that’s why this blog hasn’t been updated in a while. I was locked in on my classes, completing assignments, doing homework—and then it all stopped. It always does.

Every semester is the same: I’m focused at the beginning, then my grades start to slip, and eventually I’m here writing a blog post and praying things magically work out. Maybe it started on a day I decided to take it easy. Or a day I slept in. Or skipped class thinking, *“I’ll catch up later.”* But I can’t point to one moment where it all went wrong It was a slow decay. A series of days where I lost momentum—and it all snowballed from there.

I think that’s what adulting actually is. No one holds your hand. It’s just you choosing discipline or paying for the lack of it.

A friend once told me, “Discipline is always greater than motivation.” I didn’t get it back then, but I do now. I relied too much on fleeting inspiration instead of building habits that could carry me through the dip. And now, here I am—trying to salvage a 2.4 GPA and still somehow attend grad school.

And what do I have to show for a whole semester? No research opportunities. Grades in the trash. Zero consistency. And yet, if you gave me a redo on this semester, I wouldn’t change a thing. Because that’s who I am. I don’t live in “what ifs.” I live in the moment, with disregard for the future. Maybe that’s self-sabotage. But weirdly, I’m happy.

I can’t pretend I’m someone else. I can’t strive for more if I don’t even know what “more” means. All I can do now is deal with the fallout of a semester I chose to fumble.
