# Disconnectedness

*June 5, 2025*

Throughout this blog, you’ll probably get a clearer picture of the kind of person I am: the music I like, the people I avoid, and… the way I “see” the world?  
No, that’s not quite right. I’ll circle back to that.

I consider myself a deeply philosophical person. That has its uses—since I reflect a lot, maybe too much. But it also means I’m not what you’d call a “math person.” I don’t naturally think in equations or visualize the world in clean, quantitative terms the way a physicist needs to. I can’t exactly describe the world I see. It’s not that I don’t want to—it’s just that I haven't figured out how to translate the way I feel about the universe into the language that physics requires.

Wait, that’s it. “Feel” was the word I was looking for earlier.

I categorize things, and “visualize” them in terms of how they feel to me. Things I like, things I avoid, things that confuse or inspire me—it’s all mapped out emotionally. My internal model of the world isn’t numerical. It’s abstract and incomplete.  
And I know I need to stop relying on instinct and start trusting the numbers.

But I’ve always believed that there’s more than one answer. More than one way a problem could be solved. More than one lens to look through. That’s probably why I struggle with the rigidity of academic physics. It asks for one path, one solution, one method that’s “correct.”

That’s part of the problem. I overthink and hesitate on problems I should have just solved. But it also feels important. Like maybe there’s something valuable in being this version of me—even if it costs me points, or grades, or confidence.

But physics doesn’t care how I feel. In a sense, that’s the beauty of it. Equations aren’t impressed by your intuition. Assignments don’t grade you on how you think, but purely on what you do. They grade you on whether you solved the integral or not. Whether you used the right units. Whether your vector calculus matched the back of the textbook.

So in theory, it should be simple—one answer, one solution. But it’s not. Not for me.

And when your whole way of seeing the world doesn’t line up with how you're expected to, every mistake feels like a flaw in who you are—not just in your work. I know that’s not true. But it feels true.

Still, I keep coming back to it. The math. The struggle. The disconnect.  
Not because I enjoy failing, but because I haven’t found anything else that feels this close to meaning. Because even when I don’t get the numbers right, I still want to understand. I still believe there’s something worth chasing in all of this.

Maybe the way I see the universe doesn’t fit physics.  
But I have to make it work. Because I don’t really have a choice.
